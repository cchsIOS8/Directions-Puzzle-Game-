# Directions-Puzzle-Game-
 a program that implements the previous maze using references to instances of a Node struct which contains the name of the node and four pointers, one for each of the directions. Each node in the graph will correspond to an instance of Node. The edges correspond to links that connect one node to another and can be represented as pointers to other nodes.      Start the user in node A. The userâ€™s goal is to reach the finish in node L. The program should output possible moves in the north, south, east, or west direction.     Sample execution is shown next.     You are in room A of a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. You can go east or south.  Which direction would you like to go?  E     You are in room B of a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. You can go west or south.  Which direction would you like to go?  S     You are in room F of a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. You can go north or east.  Which direction would you like to go?  E
